### Planning
My first step when starting this challenge was to get a blank piece of paper and jot down any and all ideas that came to me for any of the three concepts.
Next I scanned through the ideas and tried to pick one I thought I could turn into an interesting feature in a small amount of time.
The idea I settled on was a wish list for a current account. From here I began fleshing my idea by creating several user stories which can be found below.

```
As a current account customer,
So I can motivate myself to start saving,
I'd like to have a list of things I wish to purchase, that I can edit.

As a current account customer,
So I know when I buy something on my wish list,
I'd like to track my spending so I know how much I've saved each month.
